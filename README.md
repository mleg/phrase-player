# Phrase-by-Phrase Audio Player

This is a simple web app that plays an audio file **phrase by phrase** using a matching **subtitle** file in SRT format.  
It is intended for **language learners**.

> It's similar to [WorkAudioBook](http://workaudiobook.com/) which I used previously.  
> But WorkAudioBook is an old Windows-only app with a somewhat complex UX. Anyway huge thanks to the author.

Subtitles are not generated by the app — you need to provide them yourself.

> It works offline, your files are never uploaded or sent to any server.

## How To Use

Place your subtitle files alongside audio files. SRT file should have **the same name** as audio file and should reside **in the same folder**.  
Choose this folder with `Choose media folder` button and the rest should be self-explanatory I hope.

## Where Do I Get Subtitles?

That’s a broad topic.  
I generate them with [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/whisper.cpp).

Videos like movies and series often have subtitles. This app accepts only audio files but you can extract audio easily with _FFmpeg_:

```sh
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 output.mp3
```

FFmpeg can also convert subtitles between different formats:

```sh
ffmpeg -i input.vtt output.srt
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. However, I’d like to keep this app simple and focused — not a “kitchen sink” solution. If you want to add features like subtitle editing, consider building a dedicated app instead.
